# McHacks9 RailVision Challenge

Hi! Welcome to our project page. Here we give a brief summary of the heuristics we used and programs we built to create our train schedules!

## Summary
The final solution we used was inspired by the traditional method used by train schedulers: manual adjustments based off of analysis of data. We developed a highly informative and rich visualization of each schedule which allowed us to pinpoint exactly where the periods of congestion and chokepoints were on our line, and how much remaining capacity was left on each train as it visited the stops. This allowed us to determine whether we should move more trains to a certain point in time. The final proposed schedule is labeled finalSchedule.csv.

## Design
Our intuition for computationally finding solutions for optimizing train schedules led us to first focus on building a "grader" to evaluate how good a given train schedule was. We also decided that visualizing the schedule would be of help to our project, and thus added that to our design. Essentially, we found that the overall workflow for developing a solution started with grading and visualizing the provided baseline schedule so that we can learn from and improve off of. We subdivided these jobs into 2 folders, TrainSolution for the grading and SolutionVisualization for the visualizing. Above you can see the visualized sample schedule provided by RailVision.


## TrainSolution

### Grading
The grading consisted of adding each passengers arrival time at each station as a value we track within a queue, with one queue representing each station. We then iterated through the schedule. For each train within the schedule, we know the time the train arrives at each station, and the number of passengers the train picks up. We can simply subtract the arrival time of the passenger from the arrival time of the train to obtain how long a passenger was waiting at a stop, allowing us to average the value when done for all the passengers.

### Solving
The solving and generation was more involved, and required the breaking down of the problem into two subproblems. The problem of choosing when to send a train down the line, and the problem of deciding how many passengers to take from each station for each train. We used two heuristics, one was that rather than trying to minimize the average wait time of each passenger, we reduce the problem into trying to minimize the number of passengers on the platform at all times. This difference might seem small, but this realization was key in allowing us create a viable program. The second heuristic was to evaluate a score for the passengers at each station, with passengers at further stations having larger scored based on the time it takes for a train to reach them. This greedy choice simply chooses the passengers with the largest wait times at each station and chooses which passenger to pick up accordingly. This heuristic resulted in the following visualization.

We encountered some bugs in the integration with our visualization code here. Specifically some plots given by our schedule generator resulted in some negative passenger values at some times at some stations. This is obviously impossible, but we can confidently attribute it to the 3 extra minutes attributed with the dwelling time a train took at each stop, along with passengers arriving at the station within these three minutes. It is not an issue with the train schedule which remains consistent with all requirements. Future iterations would remedy this bug.


## Manual Heuristic

### Visualization
Towards the end of our time in this hackathon one of our group members developed and found a more mathematic manual heuristic for designing a more optimal schedule. Though we have yet to model it computationally, we were able to find and design a schedule that performed better than both our TrainSolution schedule and the provided example schedule.

### Heuristics
The following is the manual heuristic we designed with respect to the excel visualization we performed:

Let T1,â€¦,T19 represent the respective passenger arrival times. Let Ti represent a general passenger arrival time at Station A. 

The best case wait time for passengers at Station A is 0 minutes where the train arrives exactly at the same time at Ti. Then, after the dwell and transition time to Station B, the train will arrive at Station B at passenger arrival time T(i + 1) and the minimum wait time for passengers that arrive at T(i + 1) is 1 minute.

Lastly, after the dwell and transition time to Station C, the train will arrive at Station C at passenger arrival time T(i + 2) and the minimum wait time for passengers that arrive at T(i + 2) is 3 minutes. This is reflected in the coloured fill pattern of the excel cells where the fill pattern follows a downward-right diagonal pattern. By aiming to maintain this pattern, the wait times can be reduced. However, this pattern is limited due to the limited number of trains, passenger limit for each train and trains that arrive first and last to the scheduled time period.

For the first train, the soonest that the train can arrive to Station B is at 7:11am and the soonest that the train can arrive to Station B is at 7:23. There is no possible way of reducing the wait times for passengers who arrived earlier at Stations B and C. For the last train, it must arrive at the latest passenger arrival time, 10:00am and noticeably, there exists longer wait times for passengers at Station B and Station C. However, this is due to the limited number of trains during the morning commute and as there are less passengers in comparison to the peak commuting time, longer wait times are more acceptable.
